<p><em>Students learn geometric vocabulary by drawing geometric figures with Microwords  Logo</em><br><img src="data/attachments/393c5a533c77239887f1a3cf79206484/logo-graphics.png" style="width: 10em; float: right;" alt="logo-graphics.png"></p>
<p>Students receive a worksheet with different 2D objects / figures of rather elementary geometric nature (a few strokes). Now they have to draw these figures with Logo on their computers. This trains their observation competencies, measure competencies (in particular angles), and their understanding of scales.</p>
<p><strong>Material required:</strong> "computers" running logo. This includes mobile phones running <span class="wikiexternallink"><a href="http://logo.twentygototen.org">Papert logo</a></span> in their browser, <span class="wikiexternallink"><a href="http://xlogo.sourceforge.net/">XLogo</a></span> (for laptops or desktops) or <span class="wikiexternallink"><a href="http://www.microworlds.com/">Microworlds Logo</a></span> (for Windows).</p>
<p><strong>Activities: </strong>The students are learning the basic / advanced geometric vocabulary by drawing different figures / objects with increasing difficulty. The students may start with a tutorial of logo as found <span class="wikiexternallink"><a href="http://i2geo.net/xwiki/bin/view/Coll_polx/Motifscirculaires">on i2geo</a></span>. A <span class="wikiexternallink"><a href="data/attachments/393c5a533c77239887f1a3cf79206484/graphiques-en-logo.pdf">sample worksheet</a></span> can be downloaded (although it is a bit hard).</p>
<p><strong>Organisation of the class:</strong> Students are spread across the classroom, having device and sheet in front of them. The teacher is expected to walk-around and provide advice to let students progress; he/she should know the logo syntax to realize the steps.</p>

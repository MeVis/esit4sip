<p><em>Students learn the use of spreadsheets with the help of football statistics</em><br><img src="data/attachments/78788ad10cf8aba2951813b87b09f18d/Spreadsheet-fussball.png" style="width: 15em; float: right;" alt="Spreadsheet-fussball.png"></p>
<p><strong>Lesson Description: </strong>Based on current football results, gathered from online sources, the students are invited to compute various match statistics (e.g. Bundesliga). Additionaly, students perform elementary operations such as ranking the teams according to different variables. This allows them to make predictions about the best teams. Data is acquired for the entire duration of the football tournament/saison. Due to the interest of the students, the motivation is particularly high.</p>
<p>The teacher has prepared spreadsheets (.xls or .odt) which students download from the LMS.  Then, they work with the spreadsheet by following the steps indicated in the worksheet they are given. Students who are particularly talented with regard to spreadsheets can get a less prefabricated spreadsheet or serve as assistants for the teacher, helping other students.</p>

<p><strong>Material required:</strong> PC, spreadsheet programme (e.g. OpenOffice Calc).</p>
<p><strong>Activities: </strong>The students will learn how to work with spreadsheets and formulas. They will solve mathematical problems through real world problems.<strong> </strong>The knowledge and skills gained from the spreadsheet task can, for example, be used to plan and perform a school sports tournament using spreadsheet programs. In addition to the basics of spreadsheets, students also learn how to sort and organize records for a longer period of time. </p>
<p><strong>Organisation of the class:</strong> Individual work or working in pairs</p>

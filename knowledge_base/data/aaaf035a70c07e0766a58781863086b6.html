<p><em>Combine textbook lesson and video lesson to explain and allow the creation of a five paragraphs essay.</em></p>
<p><strong><span style="line-height: 1.4em;">Lesson Description: </span></strong><span style="line-height: 1.4em;">Have a brief review of an instruction in a textbook and then provide to students a movie clip to watch with similar information.</span></p>
<p><strong>Material required:</strong> Computer and projector in the classroom. Enough computers/tablet for each students.</p>
<p><strong>Activities: </strong>I start by going through the instructions for the essay in their textbook. I explain what benefit they may have to know the model that I go through. I go through and make sure that they know the English words that will appear in the movie clip. Students will listen to an online review of how to write a five paragraphs essay. When everyone understands what is expected of them, we go to the computer room where students write their texts (can work with tablets too).</p>
<p><strong>Organisation of the class:</strong> Work with the whole class, on half a class if not enough computer/tablet available.</p>

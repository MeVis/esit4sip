# eSIT4SIP - Ontology
The eSIT4SIP approach is based on a learning and infrastructure ontology. The ontology serves as a standardized vocabulary to tag learning scenarios and design patterns in the eSIT4SIP knowledge base. Furthermore, it serves as the semantic backbone to express relations between scenarios and to link them to learning and infrastructure concepts.

You may explore the knowledge base and ontology with an interactive visualization that can be accessed here: http://www.esit4sip.eu/webvowl/#iri=http://www.esit4sip.eu/fuseki/esit4sip/get
